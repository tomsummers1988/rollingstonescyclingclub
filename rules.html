        <h1>The Rolling Stones TT Cycling Club Rules</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>The Rolling Stone Cycle Club is a dictatorsip not a democracy.</b> Dr Tom Blanks word is final and rules above even the Court of Arbitration for Sport</li>
            <li><b>Always blame WiFi, but only once per session.</b> If your avatar is spinning on the spot or your race starts late, it’s the internet’s fault. Repeat offenders must provide GIF-worthy excuses for entertainment value.</li>
            <li><b>The weight you input is the weight you own.</b> Wishful thinking doesn’t make you lighter on Zwift. Keep it real unless you’re prepared for public ridicule.</li>
            <li><b>No burrito googling mid-race.</b> If you have time to search for power-ups, you have time to pull your group back together.</li>
            <li><b>Fan or no fan, no complaints.</b> Whether you’re sweating without airflow or freezing on a turbo in winter, suck it up. Complaining mid-ride is a sign you’re not working hard enough.</li>
            <li><b>Always go “a bit harder” to break an hour.</b> If you’re finishing at 1:01, don’t expect sympathy.</li>
            <li><b>Every ride is a race.</b> Tour de Zwift, KISS, or a meet-up: if there’s a leaderboard, it’s a race. “Not a race” is only said when we’re losing.</li>
            <li><b>Excuses are acceptable, creativity mandatory.</b> From “my gut feels drunk” to “I’ve got sensor issues,” every excuse must be unique. Repeated excuses result in mockery.</li>
            <li><b>The Wattbike always goes in the car first.</b> Your disco, hatchback, or SUV’s first priority is transporting your trainer. Kids, groceries, and even your partner come second.</li>
            <li><b>A group is your best friend.</b> In Zwift races, the draft is king. Drop the group, and you’re riding alone into a virtual void of despair.</li>
            <li><b>Ride with honour: no 45kg avatars.</b> If your weight is exaggeratedly low, we’ll call you out. Uphill flyers are <i>suspect</i>.</li>
            <li><b>There’s no such thing as “too tired.”</b> Whether it’s sweet spot workouts, hill repeats, or another go at Alpe du Zwift, the group expects you to commit.</li>
            <li><b>Chatting mid-ride is pro-level.</b> If you can send WhatsApp messages during intervals, the rest of us will assume you’ve been slacking.</li>
            <li><b>Post-race banter is sacred.</b> Whether you’ve been blown off the back or claimed a glorious top 50 finish, post-race analysis in the group chat is compulsory.</li>
            <li><b>Screenshots or it didn’t happen.</b> No one cares about your FTP bump or epic race effort unless you provide proof. Leaderboard screenshots are gold.</li>
            <li><b>Always cool down—even if it’s downhill.</b> Those free kilometres matter, so spin out your legs after every race. Plus, it’s a good chance to prepare your next excuse.</li>
            <li><b>A neglected family is a sign of progress.</b> Heart rate zones, power outputs, and FTP scores take precedence over bedtime tantrums (but know when to call it).</li>
            <li><b>When in doubt, blame the steering update.</b> If your gears won’t change or your rider veers off course, the update is at fault, not your equipment.</li>
            <li><b>Ringers are welcome, but declare them.</b> Inviting your “mate” with a 4.5W/kg average? Make sure we know they’re secretly Chris Froome.</li>
            <li><b>FTP tests are races against yourself.</b> Treat them with the same intensity as a crit or hill climb. Bonus points for heart rates over 200.</li>
            <li><b>Indoor cyclists have it harder.</b> Real-world riders don’t understand the pain of staring at a screen while pushing watts into the abyss. Let’s remind them when we can.</li>
