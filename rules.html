        <h1>The Rolling Stones Cycling Club Rules</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>The Rolling Stone Cycling Club is a dictatorsip not a democracy.</b> Tom Blanks word is final and rules above even the Court of Arbitration for Sport</li>
            <li><b>If in doubt blame the WiFi.</b> If your avatar is spinning on the spot or your race starts late, it’s the internet’s fault.</li>
            <li><b>Fan or no fan, no complaints.</b> Whether you’re sweating without airflow or freezing on a turbo in winter, suck it up. Complaining mid-ride is a sign you’re not working hard enough.</li>
            <li><b>If Sellars is in the race, its draft time.</b> Don't be fooled by the 50 cadence, he's motoring - just remember to nip round him on the line.</li>
            <li><b>Sweat and extension cords don't mix.</b> Neutralising yourself mid ride won't help your teammates.</li>
            <li><b>The Norris quiff and nipple combo are a thing of RSCC legend.</b> Build the legend at every opportunity.</li>
            <li><b>If you get an FTP bump, post it.</b> You earned the praise, bask in the glory.</li>
            <li><b>Every ride is a race.</b> Tour de Zwift, KISS, or a meet-up: if there’s a leaderboard, it’s a race.</li>
            <li><b>Excuses are encouraged but creativity is mandatory.</b> From WiFi to better halves its allowed but mst be unique.</li>
            <li><b>A group is your best friend.</b> In Zwift races, the draft is king. Drop the group, and you’re riding alone into a virtual void of despair.</li>
            <li><b>Ride with honour: no 45kg avatars.</b> If your suspect the AGM scales of truth await.</li>
            <li><b>There’s no such thing as “too tired.”</b> Whether it’s sweet spot workouts, hill repeats, or another go at Alpe du Zwift, the group expects you to commit.</li>
            <li><b>Chatting mid-ride is pro-level.</b> If you can send WhatsApp messages you’re not going hard enough.</li>
            <li><b>Post-race banter is sacred.</b> Whether you’ve been blown off the back or claimed a glorious finish, post-race analysis in the group chat is compulsory.</li>
            <li><b>Screenshots or it didn’t happen.</b> No one cares about your FTP bump or epic race effort unless you provide proof. Leaderboard screenshots are gold.</li>
            <li><b>Always cool down - especially when it’s downhill.</b> Those free kilometres are gold. Plus, it’s a good chance to prepare your next excuse.</li>
            <li><b>Always allow an extra 5 minutes for the Zwift update.</b> Leaving your teammates on the start line is unforgiveable.</li>
            <li><b>Ringers are welcome, the more the merrier.</b> Just make sure they aren't too good.</li>
            <li><b>FTP tests are races against yourself.</b> Treat them with the same intensity as a crit or hill climb. Bonus points for heart rates over 200.</li>
            <li><b>Indoor cyclists have it harder.</b> Real-world riders don’t understand the pain of staring at a screen while pushing watts into the abyss. Let’s remind them when we can.</li>
